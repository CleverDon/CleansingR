# CleansingR

## Introduction

Here is the catalog of files and their purpose:

README.md - Good place to start, right?  Introduces the project

CodeBook.md - This tells you what all the files in the analysis are,
what all the variables are, and all the logic for the code base.  How we got from the screwed up mess of files that they gave us to this
nice clean dataset and analysis that makes sense.

run_analysis.R - This is the R script that takes the raw data and creates the required files described in the codebook.

tidydata.csv - This is the data after being tidied us.  Everything is tidy in one file at the detail level.

tidyactivityavg.csv - This is the average of the features (or measures) by activity by subject.  The end analysis.

========================================================
## So now what?

Go read the Codebook which gives you all the details and continue
from there.
